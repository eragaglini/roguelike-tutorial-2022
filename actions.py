This class also inherits from ActionWithDirection, but its perform method doesn’t actually perform anything, except deciding which class, 
between MeleeAction and MovementAction to return. Those classes are what are actually doing the work. BumpAction just determines which one is appropriate to call, 
based on whether there is a blocking entity at the given destination or not. 
Notice we’re using the function we defined earlier in our map to decide if there’s a valid target or not.
